There's a lot of messy code and files here. All the main ones are in the FinalRavnica folder.
I recommend not running the python code in the main folder as they were used to parse through csv.
Doing this again might(? idk for sure) wrongly append certain things but someone with more coding experience than me (which is most ppl)
can probably do this

I broke colourid_data.py so don't need to use that
THE MAIN ONE IS expansions_data.py. Running this will open the Plotly visualisation with toggle for expansions on the side.

Work done for DAAE2005 in 2020.
